(`clawhub search discord` or check installed skills)\n- [ ] If exists: Document how to configure (auth token, channel mapping)\n- [ ] If not exists: Check if OpenClaw has generic webhook/API support for Discord\n- [ ] Add Discord auth profile to OpenClaw config (store bot token securely)\n- [ ] Enable Discord channel plugin in `openclaw.yml` (if available)\n- [ ] Map Discord channels to OpenClaw targets (e.g., #general → broadcast messages here)\n- [ ] Test bot connection (send test message to verify it works)\n\n**Blocker Check:** Depends on OpenClaw Discord support\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: Core Features (Estimated: 1.5 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Implement basic Discord messaging\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Send messages to Discord channels from OpenClaw\n- [ ] Receive messages from Discord (webhook listener)\n- [ ] React to messages with emoji\n- [ ] Support thread replies (optional)\n- [ ] Message history retrieval\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Use Discord.js library (if not already bundled)\n- Create message handler routes\n- Set up webhook endpoint for inbound Discord events\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: Integration with Command Center (Estimated: 2 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Wire Discord into dashboard and automation\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Add Discord as notification delivery channel (cron jobs → Discord channels)\n- [ ] Integrate Discord into Chat page (cross-platform messaging)\n- [ ] Show Discord status in Infrastructure page\n- [ ] Add Discord channel selection to cron job delivery options\n- [ ] Support goal/task completion notifications → Discord\n\n**Example:** When a goal completes, automatically notify #goals channel in Discord\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: Testing & Optimization (Estimated: 1.5 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Verify end-to-end functionality\n\n**Tests:**\n- [ ] Send message from OpenClaw → appears in Discord ✅\n- [ ] Send message from Discord → OpenClaw receives it ✅\n- [ ] Cron jobs deliver notifications to Discord channels ✅\n- [ ] Chat page shows Discord messages ✅\n- [ ] Error handling: bot offline, channel not found, permission denied\n- [ ] Rate limiting: test multiple messages per second\n- [ ] Thread support: send reply in thread\n\n---\n\n## TOTAL ESTIMATED EFFORT\n- **Manual Setup:** 30 min (bot creation)\n- **Configuration:** 45 min\n- **Core Features:** 1.5 hours\n- **Dashboard Integration:** 2 hours\n- **Testing:** 1.5 hours\n- **TOTAL:** ~6.5 hours (distributed over several days)\n\n**COST:** ~$0.50-1.00 (if using sub-agent analysis for each phase)\n\n---\n\n## NEXT STEP\n\n**PHASE 1 RESEARCH IN PROGRESS:**\nSub-agent is currently investigating:\n1. Is there an OpenClaw Discord skill/plugin available?\n2. What is the official way to integrate Discord (API library, webhook, etc.)?\n3. Security requirements (token storage, permissions, etc.)\n\n**Will report findings to Notifications when Phase 1 research is complete.**\n\n---\n\n**Plan created:** 2026-02-18 03:18 AST\n**Approval status:** Awaiting your review\n**Next action:** Provide feedback or approve to proceed with Phase 1 implementation",

If imsg doesn't support real-time events, PoC becomes harder\n   - Mitigation: Use FSEvents or Shortcuts as fallback\n\n2. **macOS-specific approach** - Solution must run on Mac mini\n   - Mitigation: Ensure OpenClaw can trigger callbacks from native macOS events\n\n3. **False triggers** - If watcher is too aggressive, could spam responses\n   - Mitigation: Add deduplication (track last responded message ID)\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDED TIMELINE\n\n**Optimal approach:** Phase 1 research -> Phase 2 PoC (commit within 2-3 days) -> Phase 3-5 rollout\n\n**Urgency:** Medium (current system works, but inefficient)\n\n**Good time to start:** Next 1-2 hours (while other tasks are running)\n\n---\n\n## NEXT STEP\n\nApprove plan or provide feedback:\n- Should I start Phase 1 research immediately?\n- Any approaches you want me to prioritize or skip?\n- Any constraints (e.g., must use imsg CLI, no native hooks)?\n\n**Plan created:** 2026-02-18 03:45 AST\n**Status:** Ready for approval\n**Blocking:** No major blockers identified yet",
