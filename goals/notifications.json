    "message": "I was thinking about your workflow automation needs. Before I start building, I need to know:\n\n1. Which workflow would you prioritize first? (Goals, reminders, or something else)\n2. How often should notifications update? (real-time, every 5 min, every hour?)\n3. Any existing tools/APIs I should integrate with?\n\nLet me know your preferences and I can start the implementation immediately.",
