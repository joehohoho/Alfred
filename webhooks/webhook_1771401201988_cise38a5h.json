  "title": "Dashboard Phase 1 Sub-Agent Timeout",
  "message": "**BLOCKER:** Dashboard improvements sub-agent failed\n\n**Task:** dashboard-phase1-improvements (Markdown rendering + Chat search + Copy buttons)\n**Runtime:** 15 minutes 21 seconds\n**Status:** LLM request timed out\n**Output:** No results generated\n\n---\n\n**What happened:**\nThe LOCAL model (ollama/llama3.2:3b) request timed out while working on implementing markdown rendering, chat search, and copy-to-clipboard features for the Chat page.\n\n**Why this might have happened:**\n- LOCAL model may be overloaded (other tasks running simultaneously)\n- Complex file edits (Chat.tsx, types.ts, dependencies) took too long\n- Network/system resources constrained\n\n**Other sub-agents still running:**\n✅ discord-integration (Phase 1 research) — running normally\n✅ imessage-phase1-research (Phase 1 analysis) — running normally\n\n---\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Retry with Sonnet** — Use claude-sonnet-4-5 instead (more capable, faster completion)\n2. **Reduce scope** — Split into smaller tasks (e.g., just markdown first, then search separately)\n3. **Retry LOCAL** — Wait for other tasks to finish, then retry with fresh resources\n4. **Skip for now** — Focus on Discord + iMessage, come back to dashboard later\n\n**Recommendation:** Try Sonnet (Option 1) — it will be faster and more reliable for complex frontend changes. Cost: ~$0.15 for this task.\n\n**Decision needed:** Which approach should I take?",
