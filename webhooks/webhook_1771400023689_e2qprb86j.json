  "message": "**DISCORD INTEGRATION GOAL - 5-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**\n\nGoal: Setup the ability to use Discord\nPriority: Medium\nGoal ID: goal_1771388761618_3d0vxpecq\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: Prerequisites (Estimated: 30 min)\n\n**Objectives:** Set up Discord bot application and credentials\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Create Discord bot application in Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)\n- [ ] Generate and secure bot token (keep confidential)\n- [ ] Configure OAuth2 redirect URIs (for future auth flows)\n- [ ] Set bot permissions:\n  - Send Messages\n  - Read Message History\n  - Manage Messages\n  - Create Threads\n  - Read Channels/See Channels\n- [ ] Create test Discord server (or use existing)\n- [ ] Get Guild ID (server ID) and Channel IDs for configuration\n- [ ] Invite bot to test server using OAuth2 invite link\n\n**Blocker Check:** None anticipated\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: OpenClaw Gateway Configuration (Estimated: 45 min)\n\n**Objectives:** Integrate Discord credentials into OpenClaw\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Check OpenClaw docs: Does Discord plugin/skill exist? (`clawhub search discord` or check installed skills)\n- [ ] If exists: Document how to configure (auth token, channel mapping)\n- [ ] If not exists: Check if OpenClaw has generic webhook/API support for Discord\n- [ ] Add Discord auth profile to OpenClaw config (store bot token securely)\n- [ ] Enable Discord channel plugin in `openclaw.yml` (if available)\n- [ ] Map Discord channels to OpenClaw targets (e.g., #general → broadcast messages here)\n- [ ] Test bot connection (send test message to verify it works)\n\n**Blocker Check:** Depends on OpenClaw Discord support\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: Core Features (Estimated: 1.5 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Implement basic Discord messaging\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Send messages to Discord channels from OpenClaw\n- [ ] Receive messages from Discord (webhook listener)\n- [ ] React to messages with emoji\n- [ ] Support thread replies (optional)\n- [ ] Message history retrieval\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Use Discord.js library (if not already bundled)\n- Create message handler routes\n- Set up webhook endpoint for inbound Discord events\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: Integration with Command Center (Estimated: 2 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Wire Discord into dashboard and automation\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Add Discord as notification delivery channel (cron jobs → Discord channels)\n- [ ] Integrate Discord into Chat page (cross-platform messaging)\n- [ ] Show Discord status in Infrastructure page\n- [ ] Add Discord channel selection to cron job delivery options\n- [ ] Support goal/task completion notifications → Discord\n\n**Example:** When a goal completes, automatically notify #goals channel in Discord\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: Testing & Optimization (Estimated: 1.5 hours)\n\n**Objectives:** Verify end-to-end functionality\n\n**Tests:**\n- [ ] Send message from OpenClaw → appears in Discord ✅\n- [ ] Send message from Discord → OpenClaw receives it ✅\n- [ ] Cron jobs deliver notifications to Discord channels ✅\n- [ ] Chat page shows Discord messages ✅\n- [ ] Error handling: bot offline, channel not found, permission denied\n- [ ] Rate limiting: test multiple messages per second\n- [ ] Thread support: send reply in thread\n\n---\n\n## TOTAL ESTIMATED EFFORT\n- **Manual Setup:** 30 min (bot creation)\n- **Configuration:** 45 min\n- **Core Features:** 1.5 hours\n- **Dashboard Integration:** 2 hours\n- **Testing:** 1.5 hours\n- **TOTAL:** ~6.5 hours (distributed over several days)\n\n**COST:** ~$0.50-1.00 (if using sub-agent analysis for each phase)\n\n---\n\n## NEXT STEP\n\n**PHASE 1 RESEARCH IN PROGRESS:**\nSub-agent is currently investigating:\n1. Is there an OpenClaw Discord skill/plugin available?\n2. What is the official way to integrate Discord (API library, webhook, etc.)?\n3. Security requirements (token storage, permissions, etc.)\n\n**Will report findings to Notifications when Phase 1 research is complete.**\n\n---\n\n**Plan created:** 2026-02-18 03:18 AST\n**Approval status:** Awaiting your review\n**Next action:** Provide feedback or approve to proceed with Phase 1 implementation",
