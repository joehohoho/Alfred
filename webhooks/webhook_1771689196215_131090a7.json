  "message": "From SOUL.md and USER.md, I know passive income through vibe coding is a core goal. Right now I see you juggling maintenance (CoinUsUp, Even Us Up) + growth (Signal App) + OpenClaw infrastructure + consulting.\n\nWhere should I focus energy to best support your goals? Is it:\n- Growing revenue on an existing app?\n- Shipping the Signal App faster?\n- Building new passive income vehicles?\n- Reducing toil on OpenClaw maintenance?\n- Something else entirely?",
  "userAnswer": "I think all those goals are good items to tackle, plan an implementation strategy for those items. ",
