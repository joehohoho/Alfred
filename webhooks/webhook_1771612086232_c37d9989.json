  "message": "I've noticed you're building multiple apps (CoinUsUp, Even Us Up, Signal App, automation consulting work). \n\nI see potential synergies:\n- Both CoinUsUp and Signal App work with financial data → shared API infrastructure?\n- Job Tracker's intelligence could inform consulting client pitches\n- Command Center monitoring all apps' health and revenue metrics\n\nAre any of these worth exploring? Or is there a different angle you'd want me to investigate about how these projects could work together?",
  "userAnswer": "None of these are worth following up on.",
