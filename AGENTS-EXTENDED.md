# AGENTS-EXTENDED.md — Overflow for Critical Info

**Purpose:** When AGENTS.md is near its 20,000 char limit, new critical information goes here instead. AGENTS.md contains a permanent reference to this file.

**Rules:**
- Only add info here that WOULD go in AGENTS.md but can't due to size
- Keep entries organized by topic with clear headers
- Each entry should note why it's here (e.g., "Extracted from AGENTS.md" or "New — AGENTS.md at capacity")
- Review periodically — if AGENTS.md shrinks, migrate entries back

**Satellite Files Index:**
| File | Contents | Extracted From |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `GIT-CONFIG.md` | Git commit email config (joesubsho@gmail.com) | AGENTS.md §Git Configuration |
| `GROUP-CHAT-GUIDELINES.md` | Group chat behavior, reactions | AGENTS.md §Group Chats |
