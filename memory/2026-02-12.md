# 2026-02-12 - Alfred Dashboard Daily Log Count Fix

## Issue
Joe reported that the Alfred Dashboard workspace health section showed "0" for daily logs, which didn't match the actual 8 daily log files in memory/.

## Root Cause
The health-score calculation was only checking if today's log existed (true/false boolean), not counting the total daily logs in the memory folder. The dashboard wasn't aggregating the count properly.

## Solution
Updated three health-score modules to count actual YYYY-MM-DD.md files in memory/:

1. **health-score.js** — Added fs-based counting logic to read memory folder
2. **lib/health-score.ts** — Added dailyLogCount parameter and detail string
3. **sync-data.sh** — Added folder-scanning logic before calling calculateHealthScore

Each now counts regex-matched files and passes the count as `dailyLogCount` to health-score calculation, which displays as detail string: "8 logs"

## Verification
- Ran `bash sync-data.sh` at 10:54 AST
- Verified stats.json now shows: `"detail": "8 logs"`
- Synced to Upstash Redis + GitHub
- Dashboard now correctly displays actual daily log count

## Files Modified
- `/Alfred-Dashboard/health-score.js`
- `/Alfred-Dashboard/lib/health-score.ts`
- `/Alfred-Dashboard/sync-data.sh`
- `/Alfred-Dashboard/data/stats.json` (synced with count)

## Status
✅ Fixed and deployed. No further action needed.

## End of Day Summary

**Completed:**
- Fixed Alfred Dashboard daily log count display (was showing 0, now correctly shows 8 logs)
- Updated health-score calculation across 3 modules (health-score.js, lib/health-score.ts, sync-data.sh)
- Synced stats to Upstash Redis and GitHub
- Verified dashboard now accurately reflects workspace health

**Learned:**
- Dashboard health metrics need folder-level aggregation, not just boolean checks
- Sync pipeline requires coordination across JS/TS/bash scripts for consistency
- Git config discipline critical (joesubsho@gmail.com required for all commits)

**Next:**
- Monitor dashboard for any other discrepancies
- Continue token efficiency optimization
- Proactive workspace maintenance via heartbeats
