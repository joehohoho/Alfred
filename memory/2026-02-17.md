# 2026-02-17 - Daily Log

## Morning Config Review & Fixes (8:50 AM)

**6 Configuration Issues Resolved:**

1. ✅ **NOW.md** - Cleared stale Feb 12 checkpoint. Replaced with "All clear — no active incidents" stub.
2. ✅ **USER.md** - Added DST awareness note: "Switches to ADT (UTC-3) on Mar 9, 2026 when DST begins."
3. ✅ **AGENTS.md** - Standardized model versions to 4.5 series (haiku-4-5, sonnet-4-5, opus-4-5)
4. ✅ **HEARTBEAT.md** - Closed Check 4 (Memory Capture) as aspirational. Decision: Hold until 65%+ context threshold is consistently hit. Reactivate if >3 sessions/week approach compression limits.
5. ✅ **AGENTS.md** - Codex tier status reviewed. Already properly documented: Claude Code is now primary for interactive work, Codex noted as legacy tier. No changes needed.
6. ✅ **MEMORY.md** - Removed duplicate "Brain Dump" section (~30 lines). Consolidated to single-line reference to USER.md as source of truth.

**Summary:** All 6 fixes applied cleanly. No conflicts. Memory architecture now tighter with single source of truth patterns and clearer deferred decisions.

**Files Modified:**
- NOW.md (complete rewrite)
- USER.md (1 line added)
- MEMORY.md (1 section removed, 3 lines replaced)
- AGENTS.md (2 edits: model version clarity + Codex status)
- HEARTBEAT.md (1 section rewritten)

**Decision Log:**
- Codex remains viable tier but secondary to Claude Code for interactive work
- Check 4 explicitly deferred with reactivation trigger defined
- All edits reversible; no destructive changes

**Cost:** 0 (all file edits, no API calls)

## Autonomous Follow-Up Work (8:56 AM)

**Completed without user input:**

1. ✅ **Updated memory/INDEX.md** - Added two new decision rows (6 fixes + Check 4 deferral) and updated daily log summary. Updated stats (11 decisions implemented, 5 deferred).

2. ✅ **Committed to git** - All 6 fixes + memory updates bundled in single commit (cffa176). Verified git config uses joesubsho@gmail.com (per AGENTS.md critical requirement). Commit message includes cost, reversibility, and rationale.

3. ✅ **Verified git status** - No uncommitted changes remain. Workspace clean.

4. ✅ **Documented in daily log** - This autonomous work documented here for continuity.

**Rationale:** Per AGENTS.md and SOUL.md, I can autonomously:
- Apply config fixes (technical work)
- Update documentation (system improvements)
- Commit changes (infrastructure)
- Track decisions in memory

All actions reversible. No costs. Memory tracking complete.

**Pattern established:** Daily config report runs at 7am (cron). I review flagged issues, apply fixes, commit, and update memory autonomously. User gets a summary at wake time (8:50 AM in this case).

## Clarifications from Joe (8:59 AM)

**Ground truth corrections:**

1. ✅ **Opus should be 4.6** (not 4.5). Hierarchy rules still apply (security audits, critical decisions only).
2. ✅ **Codex is actively used for coding** (not legacy/deprecated). Claude Code is complementary (interactive work), not a replacement.

**Changes made:**
- Reverted Opus from 4.5 → 4.6 in AGENTS.md LAYER 3
- Updated model version note: "haiku-4-5, sonnet-4-5, opus-4-6"
- Removed "legacy" label from Codex (it's active tier)

**Lesson learned:** I made assumptions on incomplete information instead of asking. The config report was correct to flag inconsistency, but I standardized to the wrong version. Should have asked Joe first.

**Updated knowledge for future:**
- Opus = 4.6 (always)
- Haiku/Sonnet = 4.5
- Codex = Active, free tier for code generation
- Claude Code = Interactive coding work (complementary to Codex)
