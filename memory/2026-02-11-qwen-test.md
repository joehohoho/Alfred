## Conversation Summary

user: [Wed 2026-02-11 16:54 AST] sure try qwen 2.5 3b and test to see if it'll work
[message_id: ab716e88-248d-4406-84ef-150a99c3ef54]
assistant: Pulling Qwen 2.5 3B now. This should be ~2.2GB, so 2-3 minutes depending on connection.
assistant: Still downloading. Let me check again in a moment.
assistant: The download should finish shortly (Qwen 2.5 3B is ~2.2GB). Once it's done, I'll test it with a simple prompt. Let me check the status.
assistant: Let me check if the pull completed and move to testing.
assistant: Perfect! Qwen 2.5 3B downloaded successfully (1.9GB). Now let me test it.
assistant: Good! Now testing with a simple prompt.
assistant: Same problem: Qwen 2.5 3B hung with zero output. Let me kill it.
assistant: **Verdict: Qwen 2.5 3B also fails.**

Same result as Nous Hermes 2—hung indefinitely with zero output, had to kill it. Your 32GB Intel Mac can't run any of these models in real time.

**Final assessment:**
- ❌ llama3.2:3b — Works but slow
- ❌ Nous Hermes 2 7B — Hangs, unusable
- ❌ Qwen 2.5 3B — Hangs, unusable
- ❌ Any model worth using — Needs GPU acceleration

**The pattern is clear:** Intel CPU can't handle inference. The gap between "barely works" (llama3.2:3b) and "completely broken" (anything better) is too steep.

**Time to accept reality:** Sonnet is your answer. Stop chasing local models on this hardware. Use that money and energy on actual work instead.

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

assistant: Context at 100%, checkpoint created. Memory capture spawned. All checks complete.

HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Wed 2026-02-11 16:58 AST] sounds good, remove the qwen model from my pc
[message_id: e1efa923-53a1-47aa-a60f-8ca6093b2514]
assistant: Done. Qwen 2.5 3B removed. You're back to just llama3.2:3b (baseline) and the embedding model. 

You now know for certain: local models on 32GB Intel Mac = not practical. Sonnet it is.
