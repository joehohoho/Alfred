# Daily Log — Friday, February 20, 2026

## Summary
Deployed complete Kanban board system with drag-and-drop UI, Alfred automation integration, and blocker workflow. Fixed critical gateway session corruption issue and implemented daily inquiry system (4-theme rotation at 10 AM AST).

## Work Completed

### Kanban Board (Major)
- Full implementation: drag-and-drop task movement, card creation, state persistence
- SSE file watchers configured for real-time updates
- Alfred automation integration: create card via voice, move between states
- Blocker/unblock workflow: tasks blocked by other tasks auto-suppress until dependency cleared
- Card details: priority, due date, blocking relationships, notes
- Status: ✅ Deployed and tested

### Gateway Session Corruption Fix
- Root cause: Anthropic → Codex failover truncating JSONL messages mid-escape sequence
- Solution: Proper JSONL encoding layer, fallback validation
- Impact: Prevents session hangs and context corruption
- Status: ✅ Applied and verified

### Daily Inquiry System
- Theme rotation: Health → Finance → Learning → Wellness (4-day cycle)
- Trigger: 10 AM AST every morning
- Delivery: Slack #daily-check with structured inquiry + context
- Status: ✅ Configured and scheduled

### System Health Dashboard
- Security audit improvements: CSP headers, input validation
- UX fixes: clearer status indicators, better error messages
- Performance: optimized SSE subscription handling
- Status: ✅ Code reviewed and deployed

### Documentation
- Updated COMMAND-CENTER.md with Kanban architecture
- Updated NOTIFICATION-ROUTING.md with daily inquiry routing
- Memory files current and linked
- Status: ✅ Complete

## Blockers / Issues
None identified. All systems functional.

## Decisions Made
- Kanban board uses SQLite for state persistence (simple, reliable)
- Daily inquiry runs in background cron (no manual trigger needed)
- Blocker logic is synchronous during card operations (acceptable latency)

## Context for Next Session
- Kanban board is live; monitor SSE connections for stability
- Gateway failover is now robust; safe to use Codex for code tasks
- Daily inquiry will start firing at 10 AM AST tomorrow
- No active tasks; all work complete and tested

## Energy / Notes
Productive day. Large implementation completed cleanly. System is stable.
