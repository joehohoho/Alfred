user: [Thu 2026-02-12 22:56 AST] i'm going to do an update on you, is anything running at the moment?
[message_id: 58e49ddf-5a6b-4a3a-8354-2eb3616d773a]
assistant: Just the iMessage Listener cron running every minute. Everything else is on schedule (Evening Routine already finished earlier, dashboard sync runs hourly). You can disable the iMessage Listener before the update if you want, or just let it keep running — it won't interfere. What's your preference?
user: [Thu 2026-02-12 22:57 AST] if it won't interfere i'll leave it

assistant: Good to go — proceed with the update whenever you're ready.
