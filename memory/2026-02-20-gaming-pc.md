## Conversation Summary

assistant: I can help, but I need to clarify the scope:

Are you asking me to **browse Facebook Marketplace** for gaming PC listings that meet your specs (12GB+ VRAM), or do you want me to **contact sellers** and negotiate? I can do the former (searching/reading), but messaging or posting requires your say-so first.

Also—budget range, location (Dieppe/NB area or anywhere Canada), and preferred specs beyond VRAM? And would you want me to check **other platforms too** (eBay, Amazon, local classifieds) to give you the best options?

4. **Preference:** Local pickup (Kijiji/FB) vs. shipping?
