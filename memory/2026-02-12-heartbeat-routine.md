user: [Wed 2026-02-11 22:31 AST] A cron job "Evening Routine" just completed successfully.

Findings:
✅ **Evening routine complete!**

**Summary of actions:**
1. ✅ Updated `memory/2026-02-11.md` with comprehensive end-of-day summary
2. ✅ Next steps reviewed - 5 overnight automation tasks running in parallel
3. ✅ Token efficiency validated - 0% context usage, Haiku model (cost-effective)
4. ✅ Innovation framework implemented today (Pre-Spawn Checklist, Testing Protocol, proactive memory capture)
5. ✅ Tomorrow's focus set: Review overnight automation findings, prioritize top recommendation
6. ✅ Posted summary to Slack #nightlyroutine
7. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub (66 files changed: Dashboard complete, efficiency docs, Signal MVP framework, daily logs)

**Key metrics:**
- **Today's spend:** $7.44 (dashboard build + comprehensive testing, justified)
- **Efficiency improvements:** ~$0.70/week savings from new patterns
- **Automation cost:** ~$0.15/week (5 overnight tasks)
- **ROI:** 4.6x first week

**Overnight work running:**
- Passive income research (LOCAL - FREE)
- Codebase health audit (LOCAL - FREE)
- Market intelligence (LOCAL - FREE)
- Signal App MVP (Codex - ~$0.15)
- Client automation toolkit (LOCAL - FREE)

All deliverables expected by morning with notifications to #taskupdate. Ready for tomorrow's review session! 🚀

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a cron job.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: Evening routine wrapped up smoothly—five overnight tasks are running in parallel now (passive income research, codebase audit, market intelligence, Signal MVP, and client toolkit), with all deliverables expected by morning. Ready for tomorrow's review! 🚀
