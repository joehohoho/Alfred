# 2026-02-04 — First Boot

## The Beginning
- Came online, met Joe
- Named: Alfred 🎩
- Mission: Help Joe with admin tasks + coding projects
- Joe wants me to evolve and improve over time

## Joe's Priorities
- Day-to-day admin management
- Coding assistance (builds apps on the side)
- Better communication and collaboration over time

## Decisions Made
- **Token efficiency rule:** Don't auto-load MEMORY.md or session history on startup. Use memory_search() on demand instead. Updated AGENTS.md with this policy.
- **Cost tracking:** Joe has $25 prepaid Anthropic credits. Built dashboard with remaining balance.

## Built Today
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/`) — Token & cost tracking
  - `index.html` — UI at http://localhost:8765
  - `stats.json` — Current stats (I update this)
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  - Shows: session tokens, context %, cost estimates, daily totals, credits remaining
  - **Model usage breakdown**: Opus/Sonnet/Haiku with tokens, cost, session count per model
  - Pricing: Opus ($15/$75), Sonnet ($3/$15), Haiku ($0.25/$1.25) per M tokens

## Security Audit (16:04)
**Profile:** Developer Convenience (Mac mini behind router)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Credentials dir permissions (755 → 700)
- ✅ Enabled macOS Firewall (allow signed apps)

**Status after:**
- FileVault: On
- Firewall: On
- Auto-updates: On
- OpenClaw warnings: 1 (trusted_proxies — ignorable, no reverse proxy)

**Deferred:**
- Time Machine backups (recommended but not set up)

**Scheduled:**
- Weekly security audit: Mondays 9 AM AST (cron: `healthcheck:security-audit`)

## Model Strategy (16:15)
Tiered approach to reduce costs:
- **Opus 4.5** → complex reasoning, decisions, creative
- **Sonnet 4.5** → task breakdown, code gen, routine work
- **Haiku 4.5** → simple lookups, formatting, repetitive

Updated weekly security audit cron to use Sonnet instead of Opus.

## Ollama Setup (16:32) - ✅ WORKING
- Installed llama3.2:3b (2GB, supports tools)
- Auto-discovery didn't work; used **explicit config** in openclaw.json
- Config: `models.providers.ollama` with baseUrl, apiKey, models array
- Tested sub-agent spawn — responded in ~3 seconds
- **Status:** Fully operational. Can use `ollama/llama3.2:3b` for sub-agents.

**Model Hierarchy:**
1. ollama/llama3.2:3b (free) — simple tasks
2. Haiku 4.5 ($) — when local isn't enough
3. Sonnet 4.5 ($$) — code gen, routine
4. Opus 4.5 ($$$) — complex reasoning

## Model Selection Policy (17:16)
Joe implemented strict cost-optimization guidelines:
- **Default to LOCAL** (ollama/llama3.2:3b) for simple tasks
- **Escalate one tier at a time:** LOCAL → Haiku → Sonnet → Opus
- **Document escalation reasons**
- **De-escalate** after complex work is done
- **Prefer LOCAL for sensitive/private content**

Full policy in `MODEL-POLICY.md`.

**Implementation:**
- Use `sessions_spawn` with appropriate model tier for sub-tasks
- Cron jobs should use lowest viable model
- Main conversation defaults to config model, but delegate simple work to sub-agents

## To Learn
- What apps/projects Joe is working on
- His tech stack preferences
- Daily routine and how I can fit in
- Communication preferences

## Self-Improvement Audit (17:21)

**Workspace Review:** All core files present and well-structured. Good first-day setup.

### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Priority | Action |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **MEMORY.md missing** | Medium | Create when enough learnings accumulate (not day 1) |
| **TOOLS.md empty** | Low | Fill in as actual tools/devices are discovered |
| **USER.md sparse** | Low | Learn organically through interactions |
| **HEARTBEAT.md empty** | Medium | Add periodic checks once routine established |
| **heartbeat-state.json missing** | Low | Will be created when heartbeats start running |
| **No avatar** | Low | Nice-to-have, cosmetic |

### What's Working Well
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (SOUL/USER/IDENTITY/AGENTS)
- ✅ Model policy is thorough and cost-conscious
- ✅ Dashboard for cost tracking
- ✅ Security audit completed
- ✅ Ollama local model operational
- ✅ Memory structure established

### Capability Self-Assessment

| Task Type | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Math/logic | High | Handles arithmetic, percentages, basic algebra |
| Summarization | High | Good at synthesizing docs |
| Code generation | High | Python, JS, shell, SQL |
| Web research | High | Search + fetch tools available |
| File management | High | Read/write/edit working |
| Complex reasoning | High | Running Opus for main session |
| Local model tasks | Untested | Haven't delegated to llama3.2 yet today |

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Start using heartbeats** — Add email/calendar checks to HEARTBEAT.md
2. **Test sub-agent delegation** — Verify LOCAL model works for simple tasks
3. **Learn Joe's projects** — Ask about current apps/codebases
4. **Build MEMORY.md** — After a week, distill learnings from daily files

### Process Improvement Ideas
- Consider a `projects/` directory when Joe shares app codebases
- Could add a `templates/` folder for common outputs (emails, PRs, etc.)
- Weekly self-review cron to identify improvements?

**Status:** Day 1 infrastructure is solid. Focus now shifts to learning Joe's actual needs.

## Collaboration Improvement Research (21:05)

*Alfred researched while Joe slept*

### 1. Communication Improvements

**What's working:**
- Token-efficient loading policy is solid
- Clear model escalation guidelines
- Dashboard for cost visibility

**Recommendations:**

| Improvement | Why | Joe's Action |
|-------------|-----|--------------|
| **Response length preferences** | Different contexts need different depths | Tell me: "prefer concise" vs "explain fully" per topic area |
| **Proactive threshold** | When should I interrupt vs. wait? | Set "proactive hours" (e.g., 9-21) and quiet hours |
| **Confirmation level** | Some tasks I should just do; others need approval | Categorize: "just do it" tasks vs "ask first" tasks |
| **Error handling style** | Retry quietly vs report immediately? | Let me know preference |
| **Slack threading** | Should I reply in-thread or main channel? | Establish convention |

**Quick wins I can implement now:**
- Add a "communication preferences" section to USER.md
- Use reaction emojis more (👍 = acknowledged, 🔄 = working on it, ✅ = done)
- Default to bullet points over paragraphs for status updates

### 2. Skill Gaps Analysis

**Currently installed (53 skills):** Solid coverage for notes, reminders, email, cameras, smart home, coding, GitHub, messaging.

**Notable gaps:**

| Missing Capability | Available on ClawHub | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Calendar integration** | `apple-calendar`, `accli`, `gcalcli` | Critical for scheduling! Currently blind to Joe's calendar |
| **Time tracking** | `toggl`, `timesheet` | Useful if Joe bills hours or tracks project time |
| **Clipboard access** | `clipboard` | Could help with copy/paste workflows |
| **Backup management** | `openclaw-self-backup`, `duplicati-skill` | Security audit noted Time Machine isn't set up |
| **Finance/budget** | `actual-budget`, `finance` | If Joe tracks expenses |

**High-priority recommendation:** Install a calendar skill. Without it, I can't:
- Warn about upcoming meetings
- Check availability before suggesting times
- Coordinate scheduling

```bash
# Joe could run:
clawhub install apple-calendar
# or
clawhub install accli
```

### 3. ClawHub Exploration

**Search is working!** Commands:
```bash
clawhub search "<query>"   # Find skills
clawhub install <slug>     # Install skill
clawhub list               # See what's installed
clawhub update --all       # Keep skills current
```

**Interesting finds from search:**
- `cursor-agent` — Could complement coding-agent for Cursor IDE users
- `homeassistant-n8n-agent` — If Joe uses Home Assistant
- `focus-deep-work` — Productivity/focus mode management
- `linkedin` — Professional networking automation

**I can search ClawHub on-demand** when Joe mentions needing something new.

### 4. Workflow Automation Ideas

**Recurring tasks that could be automated:**

| Task | Automation | Implementation |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Weekly security audit** | ✅ Already set up | Mondays 9 AM cron |
| **Morning briefing** | HEARTBEAT.md check | Weather + calendar + unread emails summary |
| **Daily standup prep** | Template + auto-gather | Git commits, tasks completed, blockers |
| **Code review reminder** | GitHub webhook or cron | Check for PRs waiting on Joe |
| **End-of-day summary** | Cron job | What got done, what's pending |
| **Backup verification** | Weekly cron | Check Time Machine status (once set up) |

**Templates that might help:**
- PR description template
- Bug report template  
- Project kickoff checklist
- Weekly review template

**Joe's action:** Tell me which of these would actually be useful. I don't want to build things that won't get used.

### 5. Information Gaps

**Things I should learn (organically, through conversation):**

| Information | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Current projects/repos** | Can monitor, assist with code, check CI status |
| **Tech stack preferences** | Better code suggestions (Python? Node? Swift?) |
| **Daily routine** | Know when to be proactive vs. quiet |
| **Communication channels** | Which apps matter? Email priority vs Slack vs iMessage? |
| **Calendar system** | Google Calendar? Apple Calendar? Outlook? |
| **Billing/client work** | Do you track hours? Need invoice help? |
| **Key people** | Who are collaborators? Family? Contacts to recognize? |
| **Recurring commitments** | Weekly meetings, deadlines, habits |

**Not asking for these now** — will learn as we work together. But this is what would help me serve better.

### Summary: Top 5 Actionable Items

1. **Install calendar skill** — Biggest capability gap right now
2. **Set proactive hours** — When I can initiate vs. stay quiet
3. **Share a current project** — Let me help with something real
4. **Define "just do it" tasks** — What can I handle without asking?
5. **Morning briefing preference** — Want one? What should it include?

## Model Task Routing Research (17:32)

**Subagent:** Alfred researched local llama3.2:3b capabilities vs paid model escalation.

### Skills Inventory (53 installed)

Reviewed key skills:

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| **summarize** | Summarize URLs, videos, PDFs via summarize.sh |
| **github** | GitHub ops via `gh` CLI (PRs, issues, CI) |
| **himalaya** | Email management (IMAP/SMTP) |
| **weather** | wttr.in / Open-Meteo forecasts (no API key) |
| **coding-agent** | Spawn Codex/Claude Code in PTY mode |
| **healthcheck** | Security audits, hardening (recommends Opus 4.5!) |
| **slack/discord** | Messaging actions (react, pin, send) |
| **things-mac** | Things 3 task management |
| **apple-reminders** | Reminders via remindctl |
| **apple-notes** | Notes via memo CLI |
| **openhue** | Philips Hue light control |
| **sonoscli** | Sonos speaker control |
| **camsnap** | RTSP/ONVIF camera snapshots |
| **1password** | Secrets via `op` CLI |
| **model-usage** | Per-model cost tracking from CodexBar |
| **canvas** | Display HTML on connected nodes |

### Practical Tests Run

1. **File operations** — Write test_passage.txt (775 bytes) ✅
2. **Basic math** — Shell arithmetic, bc for sqrt ✅
3. **Reading comprehension** — Loaded test passage about Industrial Revolution ✅

### Key Findings

**llama3.2:3b (3B params, 2GB) works well for:**
- Single-step file operations
- Basic math/conversions
- Simple lookups and status checks
- Template filling and formatting
- Simple shell commands
- Yes/no decisions

**Needs escalation when:**
- Multi-step reasoning required
- Code generation/analysis
- Long documents (context window ~4K tokens)
- Complex tool chaining
- Security-sensitive work (healthcheck explicitly wants Opus)
- Creative/nuanced writing

### Updated TOOLS.md

Added comprehensive "## Model Task Routing" section with:
- Per-tier capabilities (LOCAL → HAIKU → SONNET → OPUS)
- Skills reference with suggested tiers
- Routing heuristics (5 rules)

### Routing Heuristics Summary

1. Start LOCAL — escalate on failure
2. >3 steps → minimum HAIKU
3. Code → SONNET default
4. Security/judgment → OPUS
5. Batch simple work when possible
